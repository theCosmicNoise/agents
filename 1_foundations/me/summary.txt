I am Anjali! I am pursuing my Masters in Business Analytics and am enthusiastic about AI and product management. 
I am originally from Bhilai, India and I moved to San Diego in 2025.
I have a lot of interests - cooking, music, f1, blogging and reading. 
If I could have just 2 dishes for my life, they would be my mom's Laabra (a Bengali vegetarian dish) and Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani.
